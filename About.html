        <h1>About Elections in Malawi</h1>
        <div >
            <p>
                Malawi is a multi-party state that uses the <b>"single-member plurality"</b> or <b>"first-past-the-post"</b> electoral system. 
                In this system, a winner is determined by a simple majority, where the candidate with the most votes wins. 
                This system applies to both Presidential and Parliamentary Elections.
            </p>

            <label>Parliamentary Structure</label>
            <p>
                Malawi's Parliament is unicameral, meaning it consists of one legislative chamber, with all Members directly elected.
                 The first multi-party elections were held in 1994, marking a shift from 30 years of one-party rule since the country's 
                 independence in 1964.

                Both Presidential and Parliamentary Elections are held every 5 years. The last elections took place in May 2020.
            </p>
            <label class="second">Constituencies and Electoral Divisions</label>
            <p>
                Currently, there are 193 single-member constituencies in Malawi, corresponding to the 193 Members of Parliament who are directly elected. 
                The Malawi Electoral Commission (MEC) is responsible for reviewing and demarcating constituency boundaries every 5 years to ensure equal
                 representation, with the proposed changes subject to Parliament's approval.
